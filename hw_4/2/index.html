            <h1> Steve Jobs</h1>
            <h2>Founding of Apple</h2>
            <p>Jobs was raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California, located in what is now known as Silicon
                Valley. Though he
                was interested in engineering, his passions of youth varied. He dropped out of Reed College, in
                Portland, Oregon, took a
                job at Atari Corporation as a video game designer in early 1974, and saved enough money for a pilgrimage
                to India to
                experience Buddhism.</p>
            <p>Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, a former high school
                friend who was
                working for the Hewlett-Packard Company. When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing his own
                computer logic
                board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally
                turned down
                Wozniak’s design in 1976. The Apple I, as they called the logic board, was built in the Jobses’ family
                garage with money
                they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable calculator.</p>
            <p>Jobs was one of the first entrepreneurs to understand that the personal computer would appeal to a broad
                audience, at
                least if it did not appear to belong in a junior high school science fair. With Jobs’s encouragement,
                Wozniak designed
                an improved model, the Apple II, complete with a keyboard, and they arranged to have a sleek, molded
                plastic case
                manufactured to enclose the unit.</p>
            <img src="./Jobs.jpg" alt="Jobs" width="300px">
            <p>Though Jobs had long, unkempt hair and eschewed business garb, he managed to obtain financing,
                distribution, and
                publicity for the company, Apple Computer, incorporated in 1977—the same year that the Apple II was
                completed. The
                machine was an immediate success, becoming synonymous with the boom in personal computers. In 1981 the
                company had a
                record-setting public stock offering, and in 1983 it made the quickest entrance (to that time) into the
                Fortune 500 list
                of America’s top companies. In 1983 the company recruited PepsiCo, Inc., president John Sculley to be
                its chief
                executive officer (CEO) and, implicitly, Jobs’s mentor in the fine points of running a large
                corporation. Jobs had
                convinced Sculley to accept the position by challenging him: “Do you want to sell sugar water for the
                rest of your
                life?” The line was shrewdly effective, but it also revealed Jobs’s own near-messianic belief in the
                computer
                revolution.</p>
            <h2>Insanely great</h2>
            <p>During that same period, Jobs was heading the most important project in the company’s history. In 1979 he
                led a small
                group of Apple engineers to a technology demonstration at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research
                Center (PARC) to
                see how the graphical user interface could make computers easier to use and more efficient. Soon
                afterward, Jobs left
                the engineering team that was designing Lisa, a business computer, to head a smaller group building a
                lower-cost
                computer. Both computers were redesigned to exploit and refine the PARC ideas, but Jobs was explicit in
                favouring the
                Macintosh, or Mac, as the new computer became known. Jobs coddled his engineers and referred to them as
                artists, but his
                style was uncompromising; at one point he demanded a redesign of an internal circuit board simply
                because he considered
                it unattractive. He would later be renowned for his insistence that the Macintosh be not merely great
                but “insanely
                great.” In January 1984 Jobs himself introduced the Macintosh in a brilliantly choreographed
                demonstration that was the
                centrepiece of an extraordinary publicity campaign. It would later be pointed to as the archetype of
                “event marketing.”
            </p>
            <h2>NeXT and Pixar</h2>
            <p>Jobs quickly started another firm, NeXT Inc., designing powerful workstation computers for the education
                market. His
                funding partners included Texan entrepreneur Ross Perot and Canon Inc., a Japanese electronics company.
                Although the
                NeXT computer was notable for its engineering design, it was eclipsed by less costly computers from
                competitors such as
                Sun Microsystems, Inc. In the early 1990s Jobs focused the company on its innovative software system,
                NEXTSTEP.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in 1986 Jobs acquired a controlling interest in Pixar, a computer graphics firm that had been
                founded as a
                division of Lucasfilm Ltd., the production company of Hollywood movie director George Lucas. Over the
                following decade
                Jobs built Pixar into a major animation studio that, among other achievements, produced the first
                full-length feature
                film to be completely computer-animated, Toy Story, in 1995. Pixar’s public stock offering that year
                made Jobs, for the
                first time, a billionaire. He eventually sold the studio to the Disney Company in 2006.</p>
            <h2>Saving Apple</h2>
            <p>In late 1996 Apple, saddled by huge financial losses and on the verge of collapse, hired a new chief
                executive,
                semiconductor executive Gilbert Amelio. When Amelio learned that the company, following intense and
                prolonged research
                efforts, had failed to develop an acceptable replacement for the Macintosh’s aging operating system
                (OS), he chose
                NEXTSTEP, buying Jobs’s company for more than $400 million—and bringing Jobs back to Apple as a
                consultant. However,
                Apple’s board of directors soon became disenchanted with Amelio’s inability to turn the company’s
                finances around and in
                June 1997 requested Apple’s prodigal cofounder to lead the company once again. Jobs quickly forged an
                alliance with
                Apple’s erstwhile foe, the Microsoft Corporation, scrapped Amelio’s Mac-clone agreements, and simplified
                the company’s
                product line. He also engineered an award-winning advertising campaign that urged potential customers to
                “think
                different” and buy Macintoshes. Just as important is what he did not do: he resisted the temptation to
                make machines
                that ran Microsoft’s Windows OS; nor did he, as some urged, spin off Apple as a software-only company.
                Jobs believed
                that Apple, as the only major personal computer maker with its own operating system, was in a unique
                position to
                innovate.</p>
            <p>Innovate he did. In 1998, Jobs introduced the iMac, an egg-shaped, one-piece computer that offered
                high-speed processing
                at a relatively modest price and initiated a trend of high-fashion computers. (Subsequent models sported
                five different
                bright colours.) By the end of the year, the iMac was the nation’s highest-selling personal computer,
                and Jobs was able
                to announce consistent profits for the once-moribund company. The following year, he triumphed once more
                with the
                stylish iBook, a laptop computer built with students in mind, and the G4, a desktop computer
                sufficiently powerful that
                (so Apple boasted) it could not be exported under certain circumstances because it qualified as a
                supercomputer. Though
                Apple did not regain the industry dominance it once had, Steve Jobs had saved his company, and in the
                process
                reestablished himself as a master high-technology marketer and visionary.</p>

      <h2>Steve Jobs</h2>
      <h4>
        Jobs's views and actions on philanthropy and charity are a public
        mystery.[294] He maintained privacy over his occasional few such actions
        which were publicly known. He has been a key figure in public
        discussions about societal obligations of the wealthy and powerful.
        Through his career, the media investigated and criticized him and Apple
        as unusually and inexplicably mysterious or absent among powerful
        leaders and especially billionaires. His name is absent from the Million
        Dollar List of all large global philanthropy.[295] Some have speculated
        about his possible secret role in large anonymous donations.[294] Mark
        Vermilion, former charitable leader for Joan Baez, Apple, and Jobs,
        attributed Jobs's lifelong minimization of direct charity to his
        perfectionism and limited time. Jobs, Vermilion, and supporters said
        over the years that corporate products were Jobs's superior
        contributions to culture and society instead of direct charity.[295] In
        1985, Jobs said, "You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that
        it’s humorous, all the attention to it, because it’s hardly the most
        insightful or valuable thing that’s happened to me."[294] Shortly after
        leaving Apple, he formed the charitable Steven P. Jobs Foundation, led
        by Mark Vermilion, hired away from Apple's community leadership. Jobs
        wanted a focus on nutrition and vegetarianism but Vermilion wanted
        social entrepreneurship. That year, Jobs soon launched NeXT and closed
        the foundation with no results. Upon his 1997 return to Apple, Jobs
        optimized the failing company to the core, such as eliminating all
        philanthropic programs, never to be restored. In 2007, Stanford Social
        Innovation Review magazine listed Apple among "America’s least
        philanthropic companies". A few months after another unflattering news
        report, Apple started a program to match employees' charitable
        gifts.[295] Jobs has declined to sign The Giving Pledge, launched in
        2010 by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates for fellow billionaires.[295][294]
        He donated $50 million to Stanford hospital and contributed to efforts
        to cure AIDS.[296] Bono reported "tens of millions of dollars" given by
        Apple while Jobs was CEO, to AIDS and HIV relief programs in Africa,
        which inspired other companies to join.[295]

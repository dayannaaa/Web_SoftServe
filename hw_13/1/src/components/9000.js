      <h2>Steve Jobs</h2>
      <h4>
        Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24,
        1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali (Arabic: عبد
        الفتاح الجندلي).[2] His cousin, Bassma Al Jandaly, maintains that his
        birth name was Abdul Lateef Jandali.[3] He was adopted by Clara (née
        Hagopian) and Paul Reinhold Jobs.[2] Abdulfattah "John" Jandali was born
        and raised in an Arab Muslim household in Homs, Syria. As an
        undergraduate at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, he was a
        student activist and was imprisoned for his political activities.[4] He
        pursued a PhD at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne
        Schieble, an American Catholic of German and Swiss descent.[4][5] Both
        of the same age, Jandali was a doctoral candidate and a teaching
        assistant for a course Schieble was taking.[6] Novelist Mona Simpson,
        Jobs's biological sister, noted that Schieble's Catholic parents were
        unhappy that their daughter was with a Muslim.[7] Jobs's biographer
        Walter Isaacson states that Schieble's dying father "threatened to
        disown her if she wed Abdulfattah",[6] so they remained an unmarried
        couple.[5] Paul Jobs was a Coast Guard mechanic.[8] After leaving the
        Coast Guard, he married Clara Hagopian, an American of Armenian descent,
        in 1946.[9] An ectopic pregnancy led them to consider adoption in
        1955.[8][9][10] Hagopian's parents were survivors of the Armenian
        genocide.[11]

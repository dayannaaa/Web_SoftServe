            <br>
            <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur, industrial designer, business
            magnate, media proprietor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple;</p>
            <p>The chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its
            acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal
            computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve
            Wozniak.</p>
            <p>Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth.
            Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking
            enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal
            computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the
            first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which
            was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in
            1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh
            introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer
            to feature vector graphics.</p>
            <p>In 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO, John
            Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company
            that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual
            effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was
            Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and went on to become a major
            animation studio, producing over 25 films since.</p>
            <p>In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving
            Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with English designer Jony Ive to develop a line of
            products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the "Think different" advertising campaign and leading
            to the Apple Store, App Store (iOS), iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, and iTunes Store. In 2001, the original Mac OS
            was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X (now known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the
            operating system a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic
            neuroendocrine tumor. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56. In 2022,
            he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>

            <h2><i>Background</i></p>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah
            Jandali <em>(Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي) </em> .<sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> His cousin, Bassma Al Jandaly, maintains that his birth name was Abdul Lateef
            Jandali.<sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup> He was adopted by Clara (née Hagopian) and Paul Reinhold Jobs. <sup><a href="#">[2]</a></sup> 

            </p>
            
            <p>Abdulfattah "John" Jandali was born and raised in an Arab Muslim household in Homs, Syria. As an undergraduate at the
            American University of Beirut in Lebanon, he was a student activist and was imprisoned for his political activities.
            <sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup>
            He pursued a PhD at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of German and Swiss
            descent. <sup><a href="#">[4][5]</a></sup>Both of the same age, Jandali was a doctoral candidate and a teaching assistant for a course
            Schieble was
            taking. <sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup> Novelist Mona Simpson, Jobs's biological sister, noted that Schieble's Catholic parents were
            unhappy that
            their daughter was with a Muslim. <sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup> Jobs's biographer Walter Isaacson states that Schieble's dying father
            "threatened
            to disown her if she wed Abdulfattah",<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup>so they remained an unmarried couple.<sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>Paul Jobs was a Coast Guard mechanic.<sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup> After leaving the Coast Guard, he married Clara Hagopian, an
            American of
            Armenian descent, in 1946.<sup><a href="#">[9]</a></sup> An ectopic pregnancy led them to consider adoption in
            1955.<sup><a href="#">[8][9][10]</a></sup> Hagopian's parents
            were survivors of the Armenian Genocide. <sup><a href="#">[11]</a></sup></p>
        <br>
        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>Schieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954, when she and Jandali spent the summer with his family in Homs. According to
        Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process:<blockquote> <i>"Without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to
        San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me."</i> </blockquote> </p>

        <p>Schieble gave birth to Jobs in San Francisco on February 24, 1955, and chose an adoptive couple for him that was
        "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy", but the couple later changed their minds. He was then placed with
        Paul and Clara Jobs, who lacked wealth and college education, and Schieble refused to sign the adoption papers.She
        asked the court to find a different family, but consented when Paul and Clara pledged to fund his college
        education.</p>

        <p>In his youth, his parents took him to a Lutheran church.[18] When he was in high school, Clara admitted to his
        girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, that she "was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first six months of his life … I was
        scared they were going to take him away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the
        time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I wanted to return him." When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve, he
        stated that he was already aware,[14] and later said he had been deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara. Many years
        later, Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that "he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as
        parents." <sup>  <a href="#">[19][page needed]</a></sup> Jobs would "bristle" when Paul and Clara were referred to as his “adoptive parents”, and he
        regarded them as his parents “1,000%”. Jobs referred to his biological parents as "my sperm and egg bank. That's not
        harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more."</p>
